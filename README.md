Tiny Binary Tree Printer in C
=============================

This is a tiny (sub-1kb) program that vertically prints a binary tree on the command line. Additionally, it prints the first two lines of the poem "Algoryhme" by Radia Perlman. 

The un-obfuscated source code, including comments, is found in the `tree_print.c` file. It is about double the size of the minified version that I'm quoting the size of. The minified source code is in the file `tree_print--unreadable.c`.

Running
-------

To build the minified source from the larger source, run:

	make

To generate the minified source, compile it, and execute it, run:

	make run
